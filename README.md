Here is a Standard Color-to-Line Weight Convention Table commonly used in CAD software (like AutoCAD) and architectural drafting. 
This table shows how specific colors are often associated with specific line weights, especially when using CTB (Color-Dependent Plot Style) files.

###Color	Line Weight (mm)	Usage
- Red (1)	0.18 or 0.25 mm	Thin lines for dimensions, notes, or secondary details
- Yellow (2)	0.35 mm	General outlines or partitions
- Green (3)	0.50 mm	Main structural outlines
- Cyan (4)	0.70 mm	Major boundaries or key features
- Blue (5)	1.00 mm	Bold emphasis or key highlights
- Magenta (6)	0.13 mm	Hatching, light details, or hidden lines
- Black/White (7)	0.25 - 0.50 mm	Text, annotations, and outlines (varies by style)
- Gray (8)	0.09 - 0.18 mm	Secondary notes or background elements
- Custom Colors	Varies	Custom mappings defined in CTB or STB files
###Notes:
1. Line Weight Units: CAD software typically defines line weights in millimeters (mm) or inches. When printed, 0.25 mm is a standard thin line, while 0.50 mm is more prominent.
2. CTB vs. STB:
3. CTB (Color Table) maps colors directly to line weights, like the table above.
4. STB (Style Table) maps named styles to line weights, which offers more flexibility than color-only mapping.
5. Custom Standards: Different companies, architecture firms, or design firms may have their own unique color-to-line-weight mapping defined in CTB files.
